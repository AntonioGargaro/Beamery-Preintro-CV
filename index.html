              <p>
                  Hi, my name is Antonio (or Toni) Gargaro. I was born in Edinburgh, Scotland where I have lived all my life. 
                  My great-grandfather moved here which is why I have an italian name, but unfortunately that's where my <i>itanlianness</i> ends.
                  I enjoy travelling and have recently came back from travelling Asia which was a very surreal experience and my first taste of Asian culture.
                  I hope to travel as much as possible and whenever I can with places like Japan, Vietnam and Australia on the bucket list.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I pursued a degree in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University as I have been interested in technology as long as I can remember. 
                  I worked part-time at Nike during unviersity which introduced me to an active and positive working environment that I now look for in every place of work.
                  After concluding this chapter of my life I have decided to move to London so I can try something new and learn more about life outside my home city. 
              </p>

              <h3 style="text-align:center;">Dissertation</h3>
              <p>
                My dissertation stemmed from my passion of cryptocurrnecies and trading them on exchanges. 
                I wanted to develop a tool that would make it easier to understand the direction a market was heading in using technical analysis.
                This required an understanding of how financial markets worked and what similiarties were present in the crypto market.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was developed as a web app that used Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to perform the technical analysis on the server and forward the output to a UI based dashboard in the browser.
                From knowing virtually nothing about developing a web app, I researched and developed this project using Python's Flask for the server and React for the UI.

              <p>
                Me and a few friends scripted and hosted a modded game server for Arma 2's DayZ Mod. 
                This was my first introduction to scripting, although it was an enjoyable experience to create something we were all proud of.
                This project actually generated profit for us through donations from the community we created.
